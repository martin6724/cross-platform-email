# cross-platform-email
Feat. mso vml code and browser fallbacks, nested tables

An example of a cross-platform compatible email design, tested for over 70 email clients, including Microsoft Office on 120DPI.

Failsafes implemeneted = Meticulously nested tables, vml styling, mso fallbacks and inline styles. 

I didn't believe all this was necessary before I started testing my emails and working with clients who use clunky software. 
For anyone struggling with Office and Android compatible emails, this might be useful!
